The speed of sound is much slower, which is why we hear thunder after we see lightning, though the two occur at the same time. For matter, the speed limit arises from the fact that, as the speed approaches that of light, it becomes harder and harder (requires more and more energy) to increase the speed. Eventually, nearly an infinite amount of energy is needed to approach 186,000 miles per second. Some of the fastest objects are particles in atom smashers. The acceleration process requires an"
